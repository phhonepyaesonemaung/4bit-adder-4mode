# 4bit-adder-4mode
A 4-bit adder with signed arithmetic modes, built in NI Multisim 14.0
4-Bit Adder (4 Modes) – Multisim Project
📌 Overview

This project is a 4-bit adder circuit designed and simulated in NI Multisim 14.0.
It demonstrates signed binary addition using two’s complement representation, supporting 4 modes of operation:

(+1) + (+1)

(+1) + (−1)

(−1) + (+1)

(−1) + (−1)

This makes it a simple but effective demonstration of how digital circuits handle signed arithmetic.

⚡ Features

4-bit binary adder

Supports signed arithmetic with two’s complement

4 predefined modes of operation

Built entirely in NI Multisim 14.0
